# Scrutiny

What I would like to do and is make a library that will allow easy and quick setup of Elasticsearch into any modern game engine.

The reason that I want to investigate this is because at GDC I went to a lot of tools roundtables and talks, and Elasticsearch was a something that many AAA studios use. I have used it before in a previous co-op and I really think that it has a lot of hidden potential in game development.



## Why is this interesting?
You asked what difference there would be between this and something like Unity’s built in analytics, and here is my answer to that:

As far as I know Unity analytics as a service is a bit slow, even with Unity Plus subscription. Using and ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) would allow the user to make custom dashboards for the information that they care about specifically and represent it in a more meaningful way. Elasticsearch also gives you the ability to write what it calls “filters” that would let the user customize how their data is shown.
